# KittehPlayer

A minimalistic player, foobar2000 clone. Idea is to give user the ability to create and save playlists for files on a PC, as well as being able to automatically search and download music playlists from YouTube. For now the following features have been planed (+ for already implemented, - for not yet implemented):

+ User can drag-and-drop list of files to playlist
+ User can create new playlist
- User can rename a playlist
- User can delete a playlist
- User can remove a position from the playlist
+ User can double click a position on playlist to begin playing
- User can pause playing current track
- User can stop playing current track
- User can sort files by names, respective to folders

For now player is developed for Windows only, I have in mind to make it possible to be natively compiled on Linux.
