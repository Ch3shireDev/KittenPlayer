## TODO's:

- [X] MAKE INSTALLER
- [ ] On some platforms player doesn't move track after download, making program useless. Probably it has something to do with user permissions.
- [x] Fix bug with removing playlists. Probably tabs order is messed up.
- [ ] Add loading next search pages in Results Page.
- [ ] Add cleaning music library from dead files.
- [ ] Add video downloading.
- [ ] Add saving personal options.
- [x] Add showing track title and playlist as window title.

### Music Player

I use standard Windows Media Player library and NAudio.

## Platforms

For now player is developed for Windows only, I have in mind to make it possible to be natively compiled on Linux.

## License

Full open-source-viral license, GPLv3.0.
